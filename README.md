# 🎓 Personalized Learning Pathways Using AI-Based Student Behavior Analysis

This project applies AI techniques to analyze student behavior data and generate personalized learning paths, with the goal of enhancing educational outcomes through adaptive learning strategies.

## 📌 Overview

With the growth of digital education, understanding how students interact with learning platforms is key to tailoring content. This project leverages machine learning and behavior analysis to:
- Track and analyze learning patterns.
- Identify weak and strong topic areas.
- Recommend next steps for each student.
- Enable adaptive and personalized education.

## 🧠 Key Features

- 📊 **Behavioral Data Analysis**: Analyze students’ interaction logs, quiz scores, topic engagement, and pace.
- 🧾 **Pattern Recognition**: Identify engagement trends, learning gaps, and drop-off points.
- 🧭 **Learning Path Recommendation**: Suggest optimal learning sequences using clustering and classification.
- 🤖 **ML Techniques**: Utilizes decision trees, clustering (e.g., K-Means), and basic NLP for insight extraction.
- 📉 **Performance Visualization**: Charts and heatmaps to visually depict learner progression and focus areas.
